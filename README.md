# Wind farm layout optimization based on GA and PSO
 Implementations for the Wind Farm Layout Optimization competition
 
## info
This is a project about how to optimize the layout of wind farm by Nature-Inspired algorithm.
We provided 2 folders GA_WFLO and PSO_WFLO for Genetic Algorithm and PSO Algorithm sperately.

## Genetic Algorithm
-1)The Genetic Algorithm implementation is displayed in GA.py

-2)The PSO Algorithm implementation is displayed in PSO.py

## install
  pip install numpy&pandas

### run
  -1) python GA.py for Genetic Algorithm
  
  -2) python PSO.py for PSO Algorithm
## result
  - 1)After running the GA.py or PSO.py, you can get the results in the current Directory.
  
  - 2)The jupyter notebook file has recorded the results of experiments
